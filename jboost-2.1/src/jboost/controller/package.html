<b>controller</b> 





The controller is responsible for tying all of the other components together.
Currently, the thought is that the controller may be largely re-written for
each application, or that it may take a script which describes the details 
of its operation.
<p>
Its basic job is to:
<ol>
<li> Construct the {@link SplitterBuilderFamily}s.
<li> Call the SplitterBuilderFamilies to construct the {@link SplitterBuilder}s.
<li> Construct the {@link ExampleStream}
<li> Construct the {@link Booster}
<li> Construct the {@link ComplexLearner}
<li> Read the examples and send them to the Booster, ComplexLearner and 
SplitterBuilders so that they may build their data structures.
<li> While want to boost:
	<ol>
	<il> good splits = get the {@link CandidateSplit}s from the ComplexLearner
	<il> best splits = evaluate the good splits
	<il> add the best splits to the ComplexLearner
	<il> test a stopping criterion
	</ol>
<il> end
<il> Output the generated {@link ComplexPredictor}.
</ol>
<p>
Several important issues remain:
<ol>
<li> How does the controller, control which SplitterBuilders are built for
which attributes?
<li> How are the good splits evaluated?
<li> What are useful stopping criteria?
</ol>
These questions will be examined further when we start incorporating heuristics
for adding several candidates at a time, choosing among candidates
using a cross-validation set, and using data resampling.
