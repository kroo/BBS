<b>learner</b> 

The learner package encapsulates all of the weak learning functionality.
It consists of:
<ul>
<li> Learner Families, called {@link SplitterBuiderFamily}s,
each of which encapsulates a general type of 
weak learner e.g. decision stumps, decision trees, linear rules etc,
<li> Base classifiers called {@link Splitter}s,
<li> Base learners called {@link SplitterBuilder}s.
</ul>

Each learner family is capable of constructing a set of splitterbuilders for a 
set of attributes.
Each learner family is endowed with a default policy (which may be overridden)
which determines which splitterbuilders it should use for an ExampleDescription.
<p>
{@link SplitterBuilder}s implement the data structures that make learning efficient.
The initial construction of these data structures is done when the data is read in.
Examples are added to the {@link SplitterBuilder} one at a time.
When all the examples have been added, the {@link SplitterBuilder} can then 
construct the efficient data structures and be used for learning.
{@link SplitterBuilder}s have the ability to spawn copies of themselves based on
an example mask. 
This allows the construction of another SplitterBuilder on a subset of the data.
This functionality is used as new {@link PredictorNode}s are added to an 
{@link AlternatingTree}.
<p>
Note that the SplitterBuilder requires a split function which will calculate the split
produced by a given splitter on the data maintained by this SplitterBuilder.
This is required so that the {@link CandidateSplit} can calculate the partition of the 
data induced by this splitter. 
The alternative way of storing the partition in the {@link CandidateSplit}, would be
far too costly in memory.
