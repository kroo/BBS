<b>booster</b> 
The booster package is responsible for maintaining all the information relevant to the boosting
algorithm. 
In particular, it maintains the weights and margins of the examples.
The booster allows access to the weights of examples through the concept of a {@link Bag}.
<p>
A {@link Bag} is essentially a mechanism for maintaining sufficient statistics about the weights on 
a set of examples.
