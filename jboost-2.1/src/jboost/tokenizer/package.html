This package is responsible for obtaining data and converting it into
a standard internal {@link Example} representation.
<p>
This is a two layered process with a {@link DataStream} object
responsible for reading in a specification file, which describes
the schema for the data. This {@link DataStream} object then
extracts a list of attributes in the form of strings with 
comments and extra white spaces removed.

<p>
Then an {@link ExampleStream} converts this list of strings into
actual examples.

<p>
The process is 2 stage to for reasons of modularity. In particular,
to add the ability to use a new type of data source does not
require understanding the internals of examples.
In addition, the example structure may be too heavy weight for
final classifier code that is produced.
A lighter weight version of examples could be implemented for 
each final classifier and this would not require re-writing 
the DataStream.
<p>
Among the package's responsibilities:
<ul>
<li>
Spot errors in the specification and data files.
<li>
Simplify tex (stem words and transform them to lower-case)
<li>
Add helpful attributes (attribute's existence, size and word frequency)
<li>
Tokenize meaningful words (such as $ amounts), potentially add a numerical
field.
<li>
Transform text into a stream of tokens.
<li>
Process n-grams
<li>
Generating efficient pre-processing java code for a specific
classifier (the generated efficient classifiers should include all
that is needed to process raw information).
</ul>
