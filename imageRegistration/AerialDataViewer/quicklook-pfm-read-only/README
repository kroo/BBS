1 Introduction:
---------------

  You need Xcode and Leopard (Quicklook was introduced in Leopard) to compile
  the program.



2 Compilation :
---------------

  You can either use the command line version by simply typing in

  $ make

  (without $) in the directory, or you can use XCode directly to open the
  project and compile it yourself.



3 Installation :
----------------

  The final program is build in the build/Relase directory. In order to use
  the plugin, you have to copy it to a Quicklook location as, e.g.

  ~/Library/QuickLook/

  and restart the Finder (killall Finder in terminal, or logout/login).

  Now, the plugin should work.
