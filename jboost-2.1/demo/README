These files are for testing JBoost.  Below is a brief description
of the datasets.

Noisy Line

The noisy line dataset is an artificial construction to test
BrownBoost's resistance to noisy data.  The function that generated
the training set is:
          
         +1    if x < .5  (w/prob 90%)
  f(x) = 
         -1    if x > .5  (w/prob 90%)

The test set is the deterministic version of the function
          
         +1    if x < .5
  f(x) = 
         -1    if x > .5
